### Data Mining the Water Table 
Using data from Taarifa and the Tanzanian Ministry of Water, i will predict which pumps are functional, which need some repairs, and which don't work at all. This is an intermediate-level practice competition. Predict one of these three classes based on a number of variables about what kind of pump is operating, when it was installed, and how it is managed. A smart understanding of which waterpoints will fail can improve maintenance operations and ensure that clean, potable water is available to communities across Tanzania.
